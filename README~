Implementation:
--------------
commands needed to run this 
 scalac project1.scala
 scala project1 4 
   
To run this part of project you can pass two parameters , first one is for number of zeros second parameter is no of actors.
by default zeros will be 5 and no of actors will be eight 

Distributed Implementation:
--------------------------
This part of project is done in two different files Server.scala which acts client accommodating server ,takes no of zeroes as argument and Client.scala which acts client ,takes server ip as argument
To run succesfully these scala files need to be kept in different projects and server ip should be determined and changed in server scala file and argument of client file.

This project can be run with sbt also which needs an built.sbt file. use commands 

Server.scala
sbt
compile
run 4 2
Client.scala
sbt 
compile
run 127.0.0.1




1). work size determination and running "scala project1.scala 4" with different sizes and actors for 
input-size      
1000	
with different number of actors

input-size
1000000
with 12 actors
real	1m32.705s
user	10m17.719s
sys		0m6.579s

cpu/real for actors 8 (which is giving best results out of 1,4,8,12)
6.7 		6.46 		5.671532847 	4.564
(1000000)	(100000)	(10000)			(1000)

Best size for workSize is 1000000 with actors 8.

2). see results.txt

3).time scala project1.scala 5

real	1m29.916s
user	9m50.700s
sys		0m6.499s

4).coin with the most 0s you managed to find 7 zeros

5). I was able to connect 4 clients to the server
